I frequently go to this site and watch2gether with friends. This automates the process of going to the site creating the room and then having to send the link to my friends.

!!!!!NOTE!!!!! - I do not recommend storing usernames and passwords in plaintext such as in this file if used. This is my best method to doing this at the moment, and if I can get the browser to remember my login, I will update this information and code, but as of now you should not do this and have been warned.
